This is my portolio of my documented programing work.


My apps so far:
  
  Math: https://github.com/JacobKnuth01/Math
  
  This was my first app that I complted in XCode whithout following a guide. It is a very simple app. Basically is gives the user math equations, and they must solve them. The user can change diffret settings, like what equations they want to practice. 
  I learned how constraints worked and over all how XCode functions.
  
  
  
  Defence: https://github.com/JacobKnuth01/defence
  
  I made this app affter I finished math. It is a game where the user sets up a base to protect their gold. They can move blocks around and set up a cannon that they control. Once they set up they can battle! There are 5 levels, and each level there is an enemy base that has a cannon shooting at them. If the user can get the enemys gold hit with a cannon or to fall on the ground they win! If the same happens to the users gold they lose. 
  
  This app in my mind is complete, but I reconize that it could be improved dirasticly. It still has flaws, but it totaly is functional. My inital goal was to get my head wraped around sprite kit, and I did more than that. I also learned a lot about inheratince. I got to the point where the app was going to consume a lot of time in the level building and polish ascpect of making a game, and I am not as intrested in that.  
  
  
  
  Python apps:
  
  This app scrapes ebay for prices, so one can know the market price of an item: https://github.com/JacobKnuth01/Ebay
  
  This project has 2 files, rat and ratClient. RatClient goes on a computer and will send a screen feed and a webcam feed over to rat. It also has the ability for rat to use the mouse of ratClient. This is still in the very early stages and need lots of work. https://github.com/JacobKnuth01/Rat
